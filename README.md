## User Stories

As a static website the user goals will be the same each time, those goals are as follows;
**Accommodation**

We would like for potential visitors to the eco-resort to be able to get a feel for the types of accommodation and services available. As an eco-glamping resort, we would like for people to know that what they will experience is not necessarily what one can expect in a normal resort. 

**Communication**

We would like for it to be as easy for a user to contact us as possible. We have made sure to include a very visible contact tab on the header which links to a very readable and accessible contact form that is responsive on Phones, Tablets Laptops and Desktop computers. 

**User Friendliness** 
I have used appropriate media queries to ensure that the layout of each page represents how it was designed. I have made sure to add several breakpoints where the arrangement of columns is adjusted to suit each device as well as adding a dropdown menu to the smaller devices to save on cluttered space in the menu. 

## Design

**Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme I used is designed to represent nature, the teal and aqua create a calming background with the orange giving the website some warmth and comfort. This has been echoed in the gallery images

![colour palette used](https://i.ibb.co/NY0X9G3/colours.jpg)

**Typeography**


![Image of the font chosen for the site](https://i.ibb.co/yB7QX43/Typography.png)
I chose to go with the Google font "Poppins". This, in my opinion, was a nice, clean and readable font which was chosen so as no to have it as the main point that the eye goes to, the hero image was intended to be the main attraction.

**Wireframes**

This is how the navigation appears on phones and some smaller tablets. The hamburger icon when clicked expands to show the menu as shown below. 

![Hamburger icon has been clicked and menu is showing](https://i.ibb.co/GnzcyMs/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-13-29-51.png)

**Footer with Social Media Links**

I have added a styled footer at the bottom with external opening links to Facebook, Instagram, X and YouTube. The links are responsive on all devices and styled to look appealing and have some breathing space.

## Features by page


**Landing page**

On the landing page, it has specifically been divided into three sections. The opening Hero image is designed to set the tone of the relaxed nature of the resort and also the website. As you scroll down we have mixed information with pictures of the facilities in order to hopefully hold a reader's attention. The third section is there to make it as easy to find us as possible, with a large visually appealing and interactive Google Map and the footer that would take a user to any of our social media pages.

![Section to find us](https://i.ibb.co/h9HJRGW/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-13-42-52.png)

**Gallery Page**

The Gallery page has been made to look clean and appealing. It gives a good feeling of the type of accommodations and generally the good vibes of the resort. It is responsive and goes from having 4 columns on a large screen down to having single images in a row on mobile devices.

![Phone gallery](https://i.ibb.co/xCzrqy2/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-13-54-52.png)

**Contact page**

The contact page has been kept quite simple, with a form that currently leads back to a formdump but would generally come back to the business in the future. The form has been tested on phones, tablets and Laptops and is responsive on all. 

![screenshot of simple contact page.](https://i.ibb.co/yWf8zcv/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-14-05-10.png)

**Future Implementations**

For future versions of the site, I would like to implement a direct booking system which will allow potential guests easily book without waiting on any replies. I would also like to implement an activities section in which people could pre-book various excursions/activities. 

**Accessibility**

I have done my best to use aria labels for screen readers as well as backup fonts and alts for all images. On testing, I got a warning that it would be better to add a title to my iframe to make things more accessible so I implemented that. 

## Technologies used

**GitHub**
 - I used this each day for version control and backing up my progress. I also used pages in Github to deploy my site early so as to keep on top of testing. 

**Codewhere IDE**
 - I used a mix of Code anywhere and the VSCode app on my computer depending on where I was working from. With good use of GitHub I found it quite easy to switch between the two. 

**Python** 
- Python was used when opening a port 8000 preview when coding in Codeanywhere.

**HTML5** 
This is the basis for the structure of my website
**CSS** 
 CSS was used for all of the style elements of the website.
**Google Maps** 
I embedded a Google map of the local area on my Landing page using an iFrame link from Google Maps. 
**Font Awesome** 
I used this for the icons on my website.	
**Google fonts** 
 I used this to import the font "Poppins" which was used on the website. 
**Favicon Generator**
 This was initially used to make a custom logo for the website but later changed to one of their stock camping images as it suited the look of the site better. 
**TinyPNG** 
 I used a compression site in order to reduce the file sizes in my gallery section. Through doing this, I was able to increase the score in the performance section of the lighthouse report. 
**Stackedit** 
I used this site to markdown the content of the Readme document. 

**Languages used**

HTML5, CSS

**Libraries and programmes used:**

GitHub was used most for version control and backing up all aspects of the project. 
The VSCode app was used for a lot of the coding. 

**Deployment:**

The site was deployed early on GitHub pages. 

**Local Deployment**

## Testing

## Manual Testing

**CSS Validator:**


![Screenshow of Css validator showing no errors](https://i.ibb.co/Hqddw0J/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-14-43-48.png)

**W3C Validator:**

Upon using the HTML, I did encounter one problem with a duplicate class. While this does not affect the page as it currently is, future versions will fix this error. I also had some green warnings which I will need to address.

![Errors to be addressed](https://i.ibb.co/tCZSm7w/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-15-41-03.png)
![info about code from the validator](https://i.ibb.co/c8zcDkm/Screenshot-2023-08-23-at-15-39-41.png)

**Lighthouse**

I used the lighthouse extension for Google Chrome which gave me feedback as to the performance and speed of the website. I tested the site with various types of internet connections including in very remote locations. The scores I recorded were good based on a decent connection. The landing page, however, had a score of 69 in performance which I would like to improve going forward in the next update. I was having a similar problem with the gallery page until compressed the files twice.

**Bugs**

One of the earliest bugs I came across was this main content showing through. It was a very simple fix which merely involved padding and the removal of the placeholder text. 

![bug number 1](https://i.ibb.co/27f5nxD/Screenshot-2023-08-18-at-15-54-40.png)

Early in my testing, I noticed that in mobile format, the text in the paragraph looked terrible. This led me to change the way I had it structured to be more semantic and then set a media query for the smaller screen sizes. Initially, I did wonder if I should change the heading size however having looked at it both ways, I and some other people who tested liked the look of the GG on top of each other. 

![terrible word layout bug](https://i.ibb.co/BjmvtZS/Screenshot-2023-08-19-at-10-25-00.png)

A small bug I came across involved the Google map and how it looked in relation to the footer. I believe there may have been some conflicting styles as I initially had trouble spacing it how i wanted to but in the end I was able to find the issue and insert a simple fix. 

![bug 2](https://i.ibb.co/cXpsgqB/Screenshot-2023-08-19-at-12-29-39.png)

I encountered some very poor performance speeds during the development of the website. I was able to use these reports to go and find the elements that were slowing things down and run them through some compression software. This led to me being able to improve my scores drastically. 

![speed bug](https://i.ibb.co/XjQXx0s/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-14-57-26.png)

I have come across a bug in the layout of the website when in phone mode. This is a bug which I am still to fix but which I wanted to mention. Ideally, I would like to rearrange the order of the About Guaro section and the image of the teepee.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge my mentor, Luke, without whom I would have been lost on this, my first project. He has given me such clear direction and great feedback that I always felt I was going in the correct direction. 

I would also like to acknowledge my wife Philippa, who supported me throughout, Even when I spent most of our 10th anniversary writing code.
