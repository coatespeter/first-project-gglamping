## User Stories
As a static website the user goals will be the same from each time, those goals are as follows;
**Accomodation**
We would like for potential visitors to the eco resort to be able to get a feel for the types of accomodation and services available. As an eco-glamping resort, we would like for people to know that what they will experience is not necessrily what one can expect in a normal resort. 

**Communication**
We would like for it to be as easy for a user to contact us as possible. We has made sure to include a very visible contact tab on the header which links to a very readable and accessible contact form which is responsive on Phones, Tablets Laptops and Desktop computers. 

**User Friendlyness** 
I have used appropriate media queries to ensure that the layout of each page is represented how it was designed. I have made sure to add several break points where the arrangment of columns and is adjusted to suit each device as well as adding a dropdown menu to the smaller devices to save on cluttered space in the menu. 

## Design
**Colour Scheme**
The color Scheme I used is designed to to represent nature, the teal and aqua creat a calming background with the orange giving the website some warmth and comfort. This has been echoed in the gallery images

**Typeography**

![Image of the font chosen for the site](https://i.ibb.co/yB7QX43/Typography.png)
I choose to go with the google font "Poppins". This, in my opinion was a nice, clean and readable font which was choosen so as no to have it as the main point that the eye goes to, the hero image was intended to be the main attraction.

**Footer with Social Media Links**
I have added a styled footer at the bottom with externally opening links to Facebook, Instagram, X and YouTube. The links are responsive on all divices and styled to look appealing and have some breathing space.

## Features by page
**Landing page**
On the landing page, it has specifically been divided into three sections. The opening Hero image is designed to set the tone of the realxed nature of the resort and also the webssite. As you scroll down we have mixed information with pictures of the facilities in order to hopefully hold a readers attention. The third scetion is there to make it as easy to find us as possible, with a large visually appealing and interactive Google Map and the footer which would take a user to any of our social media pages.

**Gallery Page**
The Gallery page has been made to look clean and appealing. It gives a good feeling of the type of accomodations and generally the good vibes of the resort. It is responsive and goes from having 4 columns on a large screen down to having single images in a row on mobile divices.

**Contact page**
The contact page has been kept quite simple, with a form which currently leads back to a formdump but would generally come back to the business in future. The form has been tested on phones, tablets and Laptops and is responsive on all.
